<h1> Image Enhancement Factor Calculation </h1>
<hr>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> This repository contains codes for calculating image enhancement factor using SSIM (Structural similarity 
index) and MSE (Mean Squared Error). We have calculated each of these values for each image we got from our three
Image Enhancement Algorithm: UM (un-sharped masking), CLAHE (contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization) and HEF (high-frequency
emphasis filtering) </p>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
<p> Check <code>requirements.py</code>  for requirements to run this project</p>

<h3> Data </h3>
<p>Sample data (297 augmented images of chest x-ray) is stored in data/enhanced</p>
<hr>
<h2> Result </h2>
<p> Results are stored in csv format (upcoming) and graph plot in ImageEnhancementFactor/output</p>
